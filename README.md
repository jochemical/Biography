# Biography

During this project I set up my personal portfolio website to present my recent projects online within the field of Python programming and web development. Besides project description it contains a short biography, contact details, and project details. 

This project is based on the course ‘Web Developer Bootcamp with Flask end Python in 2023’ from Teclado by Jose Salvatierra (on Udemy)
