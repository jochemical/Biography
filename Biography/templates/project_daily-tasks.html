                    Daily Tasks is a web application that allows users to schedule daily tasks in their digital agenda.
                    Once a task is added for the current day, it will automatically repeat for each subsequent day.
                    Users can mark a task as 'done' by clicking the check symbol. Tasks are added using the "Add" button
                    located in the upper right corner. The application includes various functionalities that provide
                    valuable learning experiences and can be applied to other projects.

                    During this project, I learned to work with Flask blueprints and utilize the current time/date to
                    create navigation buttons at the top. The navigation bar enables users to scroll through previous
                    and upcoming days. CSS is employed to ensure the application is responsive across different screen
                    sizes. A MongoDB database links incomplete tasks with those marked as completed. The project was
                    developed using Flask and employs HTML (Jinja2), CSS, and Python.
