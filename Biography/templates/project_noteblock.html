                    This elegant React web application allows users to create, edit, and delete their personal notes.
                    The interface is intuitive and user-friendly. Users can add a new note using the "+" icon and
                    complete or discard it with the "Done" or "Back" buttons. Empty notes are automatically removed. The
                    overview displays all notes along with the time of the last modification, a title, and a preview of
                    the content.

                    During this React project, I advanced my knowledge of the framework by utilizing key tools such as
                    functional components, routers, links, hooks, and state management. For the backend, I implemented a
                    Fetch API to interact with a mock API built on JSON-server. This experience allowed me to refresh my
                    JavaScript skills and deepen my familiarity with the React framework. It was a valuable experience
                    to deepen my familiarity with the React framework through the development of such an engaging web
                    application.
