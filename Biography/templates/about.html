        Dear reader, thank you for visiting my personal website. At this webpage you can read about my latest projects for webapplications and other interesting Python scripts. I started coding during my bachelor <i>Physics and Astronomy</i> at the University where Python coding is a fundamental part of the educational programme. My first Python programmes were to simulate physics processes and to model mathematical calculation techniques. I enjoyed coding so much that I started with the minor <i>programming</i> during the elective courses of my study. During these courses I got familiar with <i>object oriented programming</i> (OOP) and different languages such as C, Javascript, HTML and Python. During my two bachelor theses I wrote physics simulations using Matlab and Python. I used these simulations to investigate the spin-orbit resonance of terrestrial planets and gravitational wave signals of inspiraling binary neutron stars. I have been coding for about eight years now and I hope to keep working on many interesting projects in the upcoming future.

        During my previous employment I wrote transscription software in Python which deals with converting XML (CNXML) and HTML documents for digital learning material. During this project I got a lot more familiar with Python libraries to parse and write out all kinds of HTML and XML elements. Nowadays, I'm focussing mostly on webdevelopment by creating fullstack webapplications in Flask and working on online courses to expand my knowledge about webdevelopment. At the moment I am working on a new course which includes REST API's, Git, docker and SQL-databases.
        <!-- I hope to learn more about coding everyday and to work on more interesting projects in the upcoming future ! -->
